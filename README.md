## About OHOLCurse

The website OHOLCurse is a resource for players of the game "One Hour One Life" (OHOL). It offers tools and information such as searchable player profiles, leaderboards, a name generator, and various resources like guides and community links. The site provides data entries from recent gameplay, reports on in-game events, and support options through donations.

## Architecture

OHOLCurse has been developed using the PHP framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs) and styled using the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size) framework. Some parts of the websites relies on the [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/quickstart) package for dynamic page interactivity.

These three resources combined allows rapid prototyping of and publishing of new functionality on OHOLCurse.
